Scraped data from zillow website submitted it to a google form to store the data

## Detailed description
1. Created a google form with 3 short answer questions (What's the address of the property?, What's the price per month?, What's the link to the property?)
2. Scraped these data from a website called Zillow which has property listing with prices and addresses using BeautifulSoup library
3. After storing these data in lists, I used Selenium library to open the forms and fill in these data to store them automatically.
